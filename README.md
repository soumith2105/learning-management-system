## Project Design Choices

### Next.js (Frontend Framework)
- **Why Next.js**: We chose Next.js for the website's front-end because it's user-friendly and enhances page loading speed. Its SEO-friendly features also improve our visibility on search engines, ensuring users find us easily.
   
### Spring Boot (Backend Framework)
- **Why Spring Boot**: For the back-end development, we selected Spring Boot due to its simplicity and seamless integration capabilities. It facilitates smooth communication between different parts of our website, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
   
### MySQL (Database)
- **Why MySQL**: To manage our website's data efficiently, such as course information and user registrations, we chose MySQL for its reliability and scalability. It provides a stable foundation for storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
   
### AWS (Cloud Provider)
- **Why AWS**: When it came to hosting our website, we turned to AWS for its robust cloud infrastructure and comprehensive suite of services. AWS ensures our website remains accessible and responsive, even during periods of high traffic.
   
### Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster with Load Balancer (Deployment)
- **Why Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster with Load Balancer**: To maintain optimal performance under varying loads, we implemented an auto-scaled EC2 cluster with a load balancer. This setup automatically adjusts server capacity based on demand, ensuring seamless user experience regardless of traffic fluctuations.

## XP Values

### Communication
We ensured everyone stayed informed by regularly sharing knowledge and updates during team meetings and discussions. This helped us stay aligned and make informed decisions together.

### Simplicity
We focused on implementing only necessary features and used reusable components to keep the project simple and manageable. This approach saved time and effort, making development smoother.

### Respect
Throughout the project, we valued each other's opinions, availability, and timelines, creating a supportive and collaborative environment. This mutual respect allowed us to work efficiently and fostered a sense of trust within the team.
